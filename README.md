üìå Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and predict student dropout rates and academic achievement. By examining academic, demographic, and socio-economic data, it identifies key factors influencing student retention and supports data-driven interventions for improving success rates.

üß© Part 1: Problem Definition & Planning
üéØ Sector Selection
Sector: Education

(Sector share link placeholder if needed)

‚ùì Problem Statement
Can we detect patterns and factors contributing to student dropout and academic achievement using Big Data Analytics?

üìä Dataset Identification
Dataset Title: Student Dropout Dataset

Source Link: UCI Repository

Data Structure: ‚úÖ Structured (CSV/Excel)

Data Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Preprocessing

üêç Part 2: Python Analytics Tasks
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning
Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formats

Encoded categorical variables and applied scaling techniques

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Computed descriptive statistics

Visualized distributions and variable relationships

3Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Modeling
Applied classification models: Logistic Regression & Random Forest

Trained models to predict dropout likelihood

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Interpreted confusion matrix and feature importance

5Ô∏è‚É£ Code Organization
Structured into reusable functions

Included markdown annotations and inline comments

6Ô∏è‚É£ Innovation
Applied ensemble learning techniques

Engineered new features to enhance predictive power

 Part 3: Dashboard Design (Looker Studio)
 1. Problem & Insight Communication
Described context and summarized findings from analysis

üîç 2. Interactive Features
Added slicers, dropdowns, and drill-down capabilities

üìà 3. Visualizations
Included pie charts, bar charts, and tables for clarity

Highlighted key insights such as dropout proportions and feature distributions

üé® 4. Design Clarity
Maintained consistent color themes and clear labeling

üß† 5. Advanced Features
Used calculated fields, navigation buttons, and AI visuals
