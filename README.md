Sector: Education

(Add your sector selection share link here if available)

Problem Statement
The project aims to answer:
"Can we detect patterns and factors contributing to student dropout and academic achievement using Big Data Analytics?"

Dataset Identification
Dataset Title: Student Dropout Dataset

Source Link: ('https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success.zip')

Data Structure: Structured (CSV/Excel)

Data Status: Requires Preprocessing

Part 2: Python Analytics Tasks
1. Data Cleaning
Addressed missing values, inconsistent data formats, and outliers.

Performed encoding of categorical variables and feature scaling as needed.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated descriptive statistics.

Visualized variable distributions and correlations.

3. Machine Learning Modeling
Selected classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for dropout prediction.

Trained and validated models using the dataset.

4. Model Evaluation
Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

5. Code Organization
Modularized code into functions for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Included markdown explanations and comments for clarity.

6. Innovation
Applied custom feature engineering and ensemble methods to enhance predictive accuracy.

Part 3: Dashboard Design (Power BI / Looker Studio)
1. Communicating Problem & Insights
Clearly presented problem context and data-driven insights.

2. Interactive Elements
Added slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities for dynamic data exploration.

3. Visualizations
Implemented pie charts, bar charts, line charts, and tables aligned with analytical goals.

4. Design & Usability
Maintained consistent colors, clear labeling, and an intuitive layout.

5. Advanced Features
Integrated calculated fields, navigation buttons, and AI-inspired visuals to enhance user experience.
